# Video Script – The Rainy-Day Fund

## Scene 1 – Opening: The Crisis
**Visuals:**  
Drone over barren Kenyan fields to ASAL map highlight. Stats pulse: "2020-2023: 2.6M Livestock Lost • 4.4M Need Aid." Cut to Mary tending dry crops, worried glance.

**Voice-over:**  
Mary is a 38-year-old Kenyan farmer in semi-arid lands. Her life rides on fickle rains. She has no irrigation. She has no net. The 2020-2023 worst drought in 40 years killed 2.6 million livestock. It left 4.4 million hungry. Mary's harvest is gone. Insurance could save her. The system never has.

## Scene 2 – The Structural Problem
**Visuals:**  
Infographics burst: "89% Kenya = ASALs • 98% Rain-Fed • <1% Insured." Africa zoom: "48M Smallholders • 3% Covered • $10-14B Gap." Montage: Farmers in debt, endless forms.

**Voice-over:**  
ASALs claim 89% of Kenya. They house 36% of people. Agriculture fuels 40% jobs and 21% GDP. Yet 98% farms beg for rain. Less than 1% insured. Sub-Saharan Africa has 48 million smallholders. They eye $10-14B risks yearly. Coverage is $1-3B. This is a design flaw, not fate. Manual claims crawl months. Costs soar. Secrets breed doubt. Mary's words ring true. Why pay if it ignores my field?

## Scene 3 – Why Previous Solutions Fall Short
**Visuals:**  
Weather station vs. distant farm (gap graphic: 15-30km). KLIP/ACRE/Pula icons with <5% uptake bar. Satellite glitch shows basis risk.

**Voice-over:**  
Weather Index Insurance flips the script. It uses objective triggers. No inspections. It is cheap. It is quick. KLIP paid millions in droughts. ACRE bundled for 17,000 farmers. Pula scales via satellites. Uptake stays under 5%. Basis risk bites. Stations miss local dries. Mary loses all. She gets zilch. Premiums hit at broke planting time. Triggers baffle. 97% stay exposed. Barriers are baked in.

## Scene 4 – Our Solution: The Rainy-Day Fund
**Visuals:**  
Logo ignite. Diagram: Farmers → Contracts → Vault → Oracles → M-Pesa. Shift from "Chaos" gears to "Trust" flow.

**Voice-over:**  
The Rainy-Day Fund is blockchain parametric insurance for Mary. Smart contracts automate everything. They handle issuance, pooling, payouts. No humans. No overhead. Immutable ledgers offer total transparency. They are verifiable. Claims settle in seconds. Etherisc's pilots proved it. We scale it.

## Scene 5 – How It Works: The Farmer Experience
**Visuals:**  
App flow: Select cover → M-Pesa pay → *buyPolicy()* mints token → Oracles tick → *claimPolicies()* verifies → USDC out. Example: "9 USDC → 36 USDC Payout."

**Voice-over:**  
Planting arrives. Mary taps the app. It is Swahili and visual. She chooses drought shield. It costs 9 USDC for 36 USDC payout. M-Pesa pays. It bridges to USDC. The contract mints ERC-20 token. It is hers to hold or sell. Oracles blend stations, satellites, NDVI. This cuts basis risk. The season ends. She claims. The contract checks token, trigger, funds. Green light means instant 36 USDC to wallet or M-Pesa. No ghosts. No waits. It is farmer-led and code-enforced.

## Scene 6 – How It Works: The Investment Side
**Visuals:**  
Vault diagram: Deposit → Shares mint → Premiums in → Payouts out → Yield graph (profit/loss seasons, compounding NAV).

**Voice-over:**  
Funds come from the ERC-4626 vault. Investors deposit USDC. They get shares. Premiums pool. Claims deduct. Yields show premium surplus in mild years. They share risk in droughts. This hedges what farmers cannot. Unclaimed funds compound. Everything is on-chain and real-time. It is proportional. No tricks.

## Scene 7 – The Auction Mechanism
**Visuals:**  
Auction sim: Bids/offers seal → Demand/supply cross → Clearing price splits (payout + margin). "True Bids → Fair Equilibrium."

**Voice-over:**  
Premiums come from auction. It is fair and sealed. Farmers bid units and max pay. Investors offer capital and min yield. The contract clears uniform price. It matches supply-demand. It breaks to expected payout plus risk premium. Allocation is pro-rata. Truthful bidding gets rewarded. No games. It is a climate prediction market. Prices forecast risks crowd-wise.

## Scene 8 – Real Impact
**Visuals:**  
Zoom: Mary’s plot → County → Kenya → Region. Pops: "+13-24% Inputs • Kids in School • Quick Recovery." Paper cites fade in.

**Voice-over:**  
Mary invests bolder. WII lifts seeds 13-24%. It keeps school steady. It rebuilds herds fast. No poverty spirals. Blockchain scales free. One contract serves infinite users. Makueni maize leads to Ethiopia livestock. Marginal cost is zero. 1.5M to 48M insured. We close it.

## Scene 9 – Technical Implementation
**Visuals:**  
Stack: *RainyDayFund.sol* state machine (ACTIVE→CLAIM→WITHDRAW). ERC icons link. "93% Tests" badge. L2 gas drop.

**Voice-over:**  
The prototype rocks. The state machine handles seasons. ERC-4626 vault standardizes shares. ERC-20 policies are transferable. Chainlink oracles feed data. USDC stays stable. M-Pesa bridges fiat. It covers full cycle with 93% tests. Next comes live oracles, L2 fees under 10¢, audits. The code delivers.

## Scene 10 – Remaining Challenges & Next Steps
**Visuals:**  
Cards resolve: Basis → Multi-oracles. Reg → IRA talks. UI → Swahili mocks. Roadmap: Q4 Oracles • Q1 Pilot (500 farmers) • Scale.

**Voice-over:**  
Challenges persist. Basis risk needs multi-data averages. Vault tweaks require protocol shares. Regs demand IRA via NAIP. We engage now. Literacy calls for visual apps and co-op training. The roadmap integrates Chainlink for Makueni. L2 deploys next. A 500-farmer pilot follows with subsidies and measures. Then we explode to regions, crops, borders.

## Scene 11 – Closing
**Visuals:**  
Mary claims on phone, rain falls, kids play. Logo: "Rainy-Day Fund: When Drought Hits, We Deliver." Credits: "Blockchain Challenge 2025 | Univ. Basel | Group A."

**Voice-over:**  
Mary and 48 million get algorithms over admins. They get audits over shadows. They get instant over endless. Blockchain parametric serves feeders of nations. Join the fund. Shield the resilient.
