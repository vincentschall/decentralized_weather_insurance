# Video Script – The Rainy-Day Fund

## Scene 1 – Opening: The Crisis
**Visuals:**  
Drone over barren Kenyan fields to ASAL map highlight. Stats pulse: "2020-2023: 2.6M Livestock Lost • 4.4M Need Aid." Cut to Mary tending dry crops, worried glance.

**Voice-over:**  
Meet Mary, 38-year-old Kenyan farmer in semi-arid lands—her life rides on fickle rains. No irrigation. No net.  
2020-2023's worst drought in 40 years killed 2.6 million livestock, left 4.4 million hungry. Mary's harvest? Gone.  
Insurance could save her—but the system never has.


## Scene 2 – The Structural Problem
**Visuals:**  
Infographics burst: "89% Kenya = ASALs • 98% Rain-Fed • <1% Insured." Africa zoom: "48M Smallholders • 3% Covered • $10-14B Gap." Montage: Farmers in debt, endless forms.

**Voice-over:**  
ASALs claim 89% of Kenya, housing 36% of people—ag fuels 40% jobs, 21% GDP. Yet 98% farms beg for rain; <1% insured.  
Sub-Saharan Africa: 48 million smallholders eye $10-14B risks yearly, but coverage? $1-3B. Design flaw, not fate.  
Manual claims crawl months. Costs soar. Secrets breed doubt. Mary's words: "Why pay if it ignores *my* field?"


## Scene 3 – Why Previous Solutions Fall Short
**Visuals:**  
Weather station vs. distant farm (gap graphic: 15-30km). KLIP/ACRE/Pula icons with <5% uptake bar. Satellite glitch shows basis risk.

**Voice-over:**  
Weather Index Insurance flips it: Objective triggers—no inspections, cheap, quick. KLIP paid millions in droughts. ACRE bundled for 17,000 farmers. Pula scales via satellites.  
Uptake? Under 5%. Basis risk bites: Stations miss local dries—Mary loses all, gets zilch. Premiums hit at broke planting time. Triggers baffle.  
97% stay exposed—barriers baked in.


## Scene 4 – Our Solution: The Rainy-Day Fund
**Visuals:**  
Logo ignite. Diagram: Farmers → Contracts → Vault → Oracles → M-Pesa. Shift from "Chaos" gears to "Trust" flow.

**Voice-over:**  
Rainy-Day Fund: Blockchain parametric insurance for Mary.  
Smart contracts automate everything—issuance, pooling, payouts. No humans, no overhead.  
Immutable ledgers: Total transparency, verifiable. Claims? Seconds flat.  
Etherisc's pilots proved it— we scale it.


## Scene 5 – How It Works: The Farmer Experience
**Visuals:**  
App flow: Select cover → M-Pesa pay → *buyPolicy()* mints token → Oracles tick → *claimPolicies()* verifies → USDC out. Example: "9 USDC → 36 USDC Payout."

**Voice-over:**  
Planting: Mary taps app—Swahili, visual. Chooses: 9 USDC for 36 USDC drought shield. M-Pesa pays, bridges to USDC, mints ERC-20 token—hers to hold or sell.  
Season: Oracles blend stations, satellites, NDVI—cuts basis risk.  
End: She claims—contract checks token, trigger, funds. Green light? Instant 36 USDC to wallet or M-Pesa.  
No ghosts, no waits: Farmer-led, code-enforced.


## Scene 6 – How It Works: The Investment Side
**Visuals:**  
Vault diagram: Deposit → Shares mint → Premiums in → Payouts out → Yield graph (profit/loss seasons, compounding NAV).

**Voice-over:**  
Funds? ERC-4626 vault: Investors deposit USDC, get shares. Premiums pool; claims deduct.  
Yields: Premium surplus in mild years, shared risk in droughts—hedging what farmers can't.  
Unclaimed compounds; all on-chain, real-time. Proportional, no tricks.


## Scene 7 – The Auction Mechanism
**Visuals:**  
Auction sim: Bids/offers seal → Demand/supply cross → Clearing price splits (payout + margin). "True Bids → Fair Equilibrium."

**Voice-over:**  
Premiums? Auctioned fair: Sealed bids—farmers: units/max pay; investors: capital/min yield.  
Contract clears uniform price: Matches supply-demand. Breaks to expected payout (odds × cover) + risk premium.  
Pro-rata allocation. Truthful bidding rewarded—no games. It's a climate prediction market: Prices forecast risks, crowd-wise.


## Scene 8 – Real Impact
**Visuals:**  
Zoom: Mary’s plot → County → Kenya → Region. Pops: "+13-24% Inputs • Kids in School • Quick Recovery." Paper cites fade in.

**Voice-over:**  
Mary invests bolder: WII lifts seeds 13-24%, keeps school steady, rebuilds herds fast—no poverty spirals.  
Blockchain scales free: One contract, infinite users. Makueni maize to Ethiopia livestock—zero marginal cost.  
1.5M to 48M insured: We close it.


## Scene 9 – Technical Implementation
**Visuals:**  
Stack: *RainyDayFund.sol* state machine (ACTIVE→CLAIM→WITHDRAW). ERC icons link. "93% Tests" badge. L2 gas drop.

**Voice-over:**  
Prototype rocks: State machine for seasons. ERC-4626 vault, ERC-20 policies—transferable. Chainlink oracles for data. USDC stable; M-Pesa fiat bridge.  
Full cycle, 93% covered. Next: Live oracles, L2 fees under 10¢, audits. Code that delivers.


## Scene 10 – Remaining Challenges & Next Steps
**Visuals:**  
Cards resolve: Basis → Multi-oracles. Reg → IRA talks. UI → Swahili mocks. Roadmap: Q4 Oracles • Q1 Pilot (500 farmers) • Scale.

**Voice-over:**  
Challenges? Basis: Multi-data averages. Vault tweaks: Protocol shares. Regs: IRA via NAIP—we're in. Literacy: Visual apps, co-op training.  
Next: Chainlink for Makueni, L2 deploy, 500-farmer pilot—subsidized, measured. Then explode: Regions, crops, borders.


## Scene 11 – Closing
**Visuals:**  
Mary claims on phone, rain falls, kids play. Logo: "Rainy-Day Fund: When Drought Hits, We Deliver." Credits: "Blockchain Challenge 2025 | Univ. Basel | Group A."

**Voice-over:**  
For Mary, 48 million: Algorithms over admins. Audits over shadows. Instant over endless.  
Blockchain parametric—built for feeders of nations.  
Join the fund. Shield the resilient.
