The Rainy-Day Fund – Final Pitch Video Script (with Visuals)

Scene 1 – Opening: Mary’s Reality (0:00–0:30)

Visuals:
Dry cracked ground, a woman farming under harsh sun, simple map of Kenya, text overlay: “Kenya, 2023 – 2.6 million livestock lost to drought.”

Voice-over:

This is Mary — a 38-year-old farmer from rural Kenya.
Every season, she worries about one thing: will it rain?
When drought hits, her harvest fails, her income disappears, and her family struggles.
She’s never had insurance — not because she doesn’t want it, but because it simply doesn’t reach her.

Scene 2 – The Bigger Problem (0:30–0:50)

Visuals:
Infographic or data animation: “98% rain-fed agriculture” / “<1% insured.”
Clock ticking, piles of papers, sad farmer emoji or sketch.

Voice-over:

Mary’s story represents millions of smallholder farmers.
In Kenya, almost all farming depends on rain, yet less than one percent of farmers are insured.
Traditional insurance is slow, expensive, and full of paperwork.
By the time payouts arrive — if they arrive — it’s already too late.

Scene 3 – The Spark (0:50–1:05)

Visuals:
Dark screen with white text: “What if trust could be built into the system itself?”
Then bright transition to logo: “The Rainy-Day Fund.”

Voice-over:

So we asked ourselves — what if protection could be automatic?
What if insurance didn’t depend on middlemen, but on transparent code that everyone can trust?

Scene 4 – Introducing The Rainy-Day Fund (1:05–1:30)

Visuals:
Your logo reveal, smartphone animation, abstract blockchain graphics, soft blue/green palette.

Voice-over:

The Rainy-Day Fund is a decentralized, blockchain-based insurance system.
It delivers automatic payouts when droughts happen — instantly and transparently.
No forms. No waiting. Just data and fairness.

Scene 5 – How It Works (1:30–1:55)

Visuals:
Three-step animation:
1️⃣ Farmer buys policy via M-Pesa (use your Figma phone mock-up).
2️⃣ Investor deposits funds into a shared vault.
3️⃣ Weather data triggers payout to farmer’s wallet.

Voice-over:

Here’s how it works.
Farmers like Mary buy small insurance tokens through their phones using M-Pesa.
Investors provide capital into a shared vault that funds those policies.
When rainfall data from decentralized oracles shows drought, our smart contract automatically releases payouts to farmers — directly to their phones.

Scene 6 – Why Blockchain Matters (1:55–2:15)

Visuals:
Split screen: left “Old Insurance” (paperwork, delays), right “Rainy-Day Fund” (instant phone notification).
Animated ledger lines connecting blocks.

Voice-over:

Blockchain replaces slow, manual processes with automatic, verifiable ones.
Every transaction and payout is recorded on a public ledger — transparent, tamper-proof, and open.
Farmers don’t have to hope for fairness — they can see it.

Scene 7 – Impact & Vision (2:15–2:40)

Visuals:
Map zooms from Kenya → East Africa → Africa.
Icons of maize, livestock, mobile phones, smiling farmers.

Voice-over:

Our goal is to protect smallholder farmers like Mary — not just in Kenya, but across Africa.
By combining blockchain transparency with mobile accessibility, we can make insurance affordable, fair, and truly scalable.

Scene 8 – Team & Closing (2:40–3:00)

Visuals:
Animated network lines forming your logo, glowing softly.
Voice-over:

The Rainy-Day Fund — where technology meets trust.
Transparent, decentralized, and built for those who feed the world.
This is how we redefine insurance.
On-screen text:

Visuals:
Image of a smiling farmer or hands holding a phone, then fade to your logo.
Voice-over:

For Mary, and for every farmer still waiting for a safety net.
The Rainy-Day Fund is more than an idea — it’s a promise of fairness when the skies stay dry.
On-screen text:
“Built for farmers. Powered by blockchain.”
